# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes Prediction with Decision Trees
A foundational machine learning project that demonstrates the core workflow for predicting the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures. This project implements a basic yet powerful Decision Tree classifier, serving as an clear introduction to binary classification in a healthcare context.

Key Details:

🧠 Model: Decision Tree Classifier (from sklearn.tree)

📊 Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. This classic benchmark dataset contains medical data from patients, including features like glucose levels, BMI, and age.

🛠️ Built With: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn

Project Workflow:
This project covers the essential steps of a basic ML pipeline:

Data Loading & Inspection: Importing the dataset and performing initial exploration.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and splitting the data into training and test sets.

Model Training & Prediction: Building and fitting a Decision Tree model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using standard metrics.

📈 Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Confusion Matrix Visualization

🎯 Goal: To provide a clean, well-documented example of a fundamental classification project, ideal for those beginning their journey in machine learning and data science.
